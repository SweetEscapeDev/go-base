# Pkg Layer

The `pkg` layer contains utility functions, helpers, and shared libraries that can be used throughout the application. These components are independent and reusable across different parts of the project.

## Responsibilities

- Provide utility functions that do not belong to a specific domain.
- Contain reusable helper packages for logging, error handling, and formatting.
- Keep general-purpose implementations separate from business logic.

## Directory Structure

```
ðŸ“‚ pkg
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ logger           # Shared logging utilities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ logger.go      # Zap logger setup
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ errors           # Custom error handling
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ errors.go      # Standardized error responses
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ utils            # General utility functions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils.go       # Helper functions (e.g., string manipulation, validation)
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## Example Logger Implementation

```go
package logger

import (
    "go.uber.org/zap"
)

var Log *zap.Logger

func InitLogger() {
    logger, _ := zap.NewProduction()
    Log = logger
}
```

## Best Practices

- Keep functions generic and not tied to a specific use case.
- Avoid business logic in utility functions.
- Make sure utilities are well-documented and easily reusable.

This helps maintain a clean separation of concerns and ensures utilities can be leveraged across different modules.
